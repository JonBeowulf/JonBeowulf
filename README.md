- 👋 Hi, I’m @JonBeowulf
- 👀 I’m interested in more things than I care to list right now, but VR and VTTRPG top the list.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and playing with HTML; Unity and Unreal are next.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on VTTRPG character sheets (Roll20) and anything that pushes me deeper into Python.
- 📫 How to reach me: email JonBeowulf@gmail.com with 'GIT' in the subject.
